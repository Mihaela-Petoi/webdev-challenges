/*
âœ¿ CHALLENGE 9: Survival Game
Write a JavaScript program that simulates a survival challenge. The program should prompt the user to enter:

âœ¿ The player's name
âœ¿ The player's starting Hit Points (HP) (maximum 100)
âœ¿ A hunting skill level (between 0 and 10)

The simulation will run for a set number of days. Each day, the player goes hunting to find food.

âœ¿âœ¿âœ¿ Hunting Mechanics:
âœ¿ The chance of a successful hunt is determined by the hunting skill.
    âœ¿ A hunting skill of 0 means 0% success (always fails).
    âœ¿ A hunting skill of 10 means 100% success (always succeeds).
    âœ¿ A hunting skill of X gives an X Ã— 10% success rate.
âœ¿ Use a simulated dice roll (a random number between 1 and 10) to determine the outcome:
    âœ¿ If the roll is less than or equal to the hunting skill, the hunt succeeds (+10 HP).
    âœ¿ Otherwise, the hunt fails (-10 HP).

âœ¿âœ¿âœ¿ Logging Daily Events:
Use console.log() to display the events of each day. Example output:
```
    Day 4 starts!  
    John (Hunting Skill: 5) rolls a 8  
    John is starving... ðŸ’€  
    Current HP: 50  
```

If the player's HP reaches 0 or below, they die and the simulation ends early. Otherwise, the game continues until the final day.

âœ¿âœ¿âœ¿âœ¿âœ¿  Good luck, survivor! ðŸš€ âœ¿âœ¿âœ¿âœ¿âœ¿
