/*
âœ¿ CHALLENGE 4: Random Excuse Generator
Write a program that generates a random excuse. The program should:
1. Randomly select an introductory phrase (e.g., "Sorry, but...").
2. Select a "perpetrator" (e.g., "my dog," "the weather," etc.).
3. Choose a "motivation" (e.g., "ate my homework," "made a mess," etc.).
4. Combine these parts to form a complete, random excuse.
